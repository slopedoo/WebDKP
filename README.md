which can then be uploaded by the guild master to the
website using the SyncTool.

# MODIFICATIONS

  - Addon has been modified to accommodate fixed DKP costs. Any item specified in the WebDKP loot table will auto-fill when bidding starts.
  - To be elegible for loot, members will whisper ?main or ?off for mainspec or offspec respectively. Mainspec bid will be the price specified in WebDKP loot table. Offspec item is free.
  - Auto-award for bosskills has also been reduced to 2.
  - Use "?" prefix instead of "!", which is reserved for server commands on Elysium.
  - DKP listing has been disabled due to the spam-filter on Elysium.
